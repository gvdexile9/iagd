    <div name="DuplicateItem">
        <div>
            IA says something about duplicate or bugged items
        </div>
        <div>
            Roughly around the launch of the AoM expansion, a bug was introduced into Grim Dawn.<br />
            Grim Dawn would write to the shared stash anytime it was modified, but when opening your stash, it would read the data from memory.<br />
            This bug was "fixed" around Christmas time. However, there is still a lingering issue where GD sometimes goes back to reading in-memory only.<br />
            The consequence of this, is that when IA deletes an item (because its been looted), then GD restores the item, effectively duplicating it. <br /><br />
            In order to prevent duplicate items being stored in IA (items created due to this bug), IA now refuses to loot items it identifies as bug-duplicated.<br />
            (A side effect of this is that IA also refuses to loot components, because they are the only <i>non-bugged</i> true duplicate items in the game)<br />
            <br />

            Basically, if you search in IA, you should always <a href="http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showpost.php?p=723684&postcount=2073">find an item stored with the <b>exact same stats</b></a> as the item that IA is refusing to loot. <br />
            This is the original item, and the one in GD is the duplicated one.
        </div>

            <br><br>
            IA takes daily backups of your items and keeps copies of the the previous 100 stash files.<br>
            Most likely the wrong mod is selected or you just need to parse the GD database.<br><br>
            If you click Win+R at the same time, and then type: <u>%appdata%\..\local\evilsoft\iagd\backup</u> <br />
            That should show all of your previous 100 stashes. Sort them by timestamp, fetch the newest, rename it to <u>transfer.gst</u> <br />
            And just copy it into your Grim Dawn save folder. <br />

        <div>
            Yes, yes and yes.<br>
            IA will never modify any of your items, and will always reproduce them <u>exactly</u> as it found them.<br>
            Even if merging items is enabled, your items will remain unchanged. <br>

        What does it mean to use IA on multiple PCs?
    </div>
    <div>
        If you have online backups enabled via the email login (backup tab)<br />
        Then IA can synchronize your items between installs, if you're playing GD on two different computers.<br/>
        IA will not synchronize your characters, only your items.<br/>
        The checkbox essentially trades bandwidth usage for more frequent updates.

<div name="DeleteDuplicates">
    <div>
        What does it mean for IA to delete duplicates?
    </div>
    <div>
        For a detailed description of what a "duplicate" item is, see the entries on "bugged or duplicate items".<br/>
        <b>The short version is:</b> IA has already looted the item, but a copy remains in-game. You only found one, but you now have two of the exact same item.<br/>
        These are not items which happens to have the same stats, they are duplicates which were created due to a bug.<br/><br/>
        Enabling this option will cause IA to simply delete them, instead of just warning you and refuse to loot them.

        <div>
            Item Assistant does not have any direct integration with these services. <br />
            The way IA creates backups to say Dropbox is by detecting the installation folder, and placing a zip file there with the daily backup.<br />
            The same can be achieved by choosing "custom" and simply navigating to the folder of your cloud provider.<br /><br />
            If the icon is disabled, it means IA was not able to automatically detect where you have the cloud sync installed, and you will have to enable it manually via custom backups.

            <br>
            If this is the first time you're using IA and have just looted items, try restarting IA.<br>
            IA may take a restart to detect mods and stashes after looting its very first item.

            How do i restore a transfer stash? (lost items from tab1 / tab2 for example)
        </div>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Close Grim Dawn (or at least go to the main menu)</li>
                <li>In IA go to settings</li>
                <li>Click "View Logs"</li>
                <li>Enter the "backup" folder</li>
                <li>You're looking for a file named transfer-something, look at the timestamps to find the correct one</li>
                <li>Once you think you've found the correct transfer copy, go to "my documents"\"my games"\"grim dawn"\"save"</li>
                <li>Find transfer.gst and rename it to transfer-renamed.gst</li>
                <li>Copy the transfer file from the backup folder into the save\ folder</li>
                <li>Rename the copied file to "transfer.gst"</li>
                <li>Open Grim dawn and go pick up your items from the stash</li>
                <li>Close grim dawn</li>
                <li>Delete the copied file, and rename the transfer-renamed.gst to transfer.gst to restore your stash</li>
            </ol>

            IA keeps the last 100 copies of your transfer stash, so you may need to guess which file you need based on the timestamp.
            <br>
            Remember: only you know when this happened.

            This is by far the most common issue in IA.<br>
            <br>
            Cloud saving have to be disabled in <u>two</u> locations.

            Item Assistant says some files are missing, and that Avast may be to blame!?
        </div>
        <div>
            The way Item Assistant detects if your stash is open or closed, is by injecting code into Grim Dawn.<br />
            Some super paranoid anti virus / anti malware programs tends to handle this by simply deleting Item Assistant.<br />
            They never tell you, so you never realize what the cause is.<br /><br />
            The main culprit here is Avast, but other anti virus programs has been known to sometimes freak out as well. <br />
            The only way to notice is by going into the logs of the anti virus and see that it has interferred without notifying you.<br /><br />
            In order to continue using IA, you must whitelist it in whatever god forsaken anti virus program you're using, and then completely reinstall IA.<br />
            If you are reading this message, your "anti" virus program has already wiped out half the things IA needs to keep working properly.<br /><br />
            Good luck, don't blame me. The problem is not IA.
